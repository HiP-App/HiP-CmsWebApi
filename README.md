HiPCMS
======
Develop: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HiP-App/HiP-CmsWebApi.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/HiP-App/HiP-CmsWebApi/)

HiP-CmsWebApi is a content management system which is developed by the project group [History in 
Paderborn](http://is.uni-paderborn.de/fachgebiete/fg-engels/lehre/ss15/hip-app/pg-hip-app.html).
It is developed to fill the system 'History in Paderborn' with data. This is only a REST API with service end points. We 
also develop client applicaion to consume this REST API. The client application is built on AngularJS.

In another team of the project group, an Android app is developed that will 
make the content of HiPCMS accessable to the public. Information about the app 
will be added as soon as it is available.

HiPCMS will replace the original project which was known as [HiPBackend](https://hip.upb.de/).
HiPBackend's code unfortunately was not maintainable anymore and a rewrite was decided.
